## 5 Physician's Comments

## 6 Declarations and Confirmation by the Patient

It is known to me that it is not possible to claim a refund for the same amounts from different parties (such as other insurance compnies or HMOs) and receipt of double refunds is a violation of the instructions of the law and the instructions of the insurance policy. My signature is confirmation and an undertaking on my part that I will report to Harel Insurance Company any monetary payment I receive from any other party in regard of this invoice, and I hereby allow Harel Insurance Company  to make any examination whatsoever regarding my entitlement to a refund/compensation in regard of this invoice.

By signing, I confirm my waiver of medical confidentiality in favor of Harel and instruct the provision of any information from my medical file and/or the medical record from any institution as necessary to the Insurer in order to settle my request. I have and will not have any complaint and/or claim to any party in regard of this request of mine.

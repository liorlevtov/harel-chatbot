- ■ For your information, a request for cancellation of a policy in its entirety will lead to cancellation of all the insurance coverages existing for you in the policy you ask to cancel.
- ■  Regarding a coverage that has been cancelled, no insurance event that occurs after cancellation of the insurance will  be  covered  and  you  will  not  be  entitled  to  any  indemnity  or  compensation  by  force  of  that  coverage.  In addition, if you apply in the future to rejoin the insurance, this may involve a renewed process of medical or other underwriting, with the renewed agreement of the insurance company to accept you to the insurance plan and under the terms and rates that are customary in the Company of the day of your application.
- ■  In addition, if your application to rejoin the insurance is approved, the policy issued will be a new policy for all intents and purposes.

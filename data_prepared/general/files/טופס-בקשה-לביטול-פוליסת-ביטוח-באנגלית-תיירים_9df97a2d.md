- ■ For your information, a request for cancellation of a policy in its entirety will lead to cancellation of all the insurance coverages existing for you in the policy you request to cancel.
- ■ Regarding a coverage that has been cancelled, no insurance event that occurs after cancellation of the insurance will be covered and you will not be entitled to any indemnity or compensation by force of that coverage. In addition, if you apply in the future to rejoin the insurance, this may involve a renewed process of medical or other underwriting, with the renewed agreement of the insurance company to accept you to the insurance plan and under the terms and rates that are customary in the Company of the day of your application.
- ■ In addition, if your application to rejoin the insurance is approved, the policy issued will be a new policy for all intents and purposes.

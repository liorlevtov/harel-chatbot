## M Prescription paragraph

We would like to bring to your attention that in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 31 of the Insurance Contract Law 5741-1981, insofar as the inception date of your individual policy is after 25.11.2020, the prescription period for fling a claim is fve years from the occurrence of an insured event.

In so far as the inception date of your individual policy is before 25.11.2020, the prescription period for fling a claim is three years from the occurrence of an insured event.

Under the Mushlam Nursing Plus policy for members of Clalit Health Services - the prescription period for fling a claim is three years after the occurrence of an insured event.

Please note that in nursing claims, the insured event occurs on a daily basis and therefore the count of the prescription period commences on a daily basis for that day, as long as the insured event lasts.

In general, fling a claim with an institutional body does not stop the prescription race - which is stopped only upon fling a claim in court.

In the event of a claim by a minor, the calculation of the prescription period shall not take into account the period when the plaintiff has not yet turned eighteen years of age.

Comment: To the extent that there is a unique arrangement under the terms of a particular policy, the provisions of the unique arrangement will prevail over the above and all in connection with coverage under that policy.

- a.  Functional disability - Poor health and functioning condition of the insured as a result of illness, accident or health impairment, as a result of which the insured is unable to independently perform a substantial part (at least 50% of the action), of at least a certain number, as specified in the policy, of the following actions:
1. Getting up and lying down: The insured's independent ability to move from lying down to a seated position and/or getting up from a chair, including performing this action from a wheelchair and/or bed.
2. Dressing and undressing: The insured's independent ability to dress and/or undress clothing items of any type, including connecting or fitting a medical belt or artificial limb. In the Mushlam Nursing policy for Clalit Health Services members, where the insured event occurred from 01/01/2025 onwards, the insured's ability to dress independently with adapted clothing and/or with the assistance of an accessory in performing the action - shall not be deemed an entitling condition.
3. Bathing: The insured's independent ability to bathe in a bath, shower in a shower, or in any acceptable manner, including entry and exit actions from the bath or shower. In the Mushlam Nursing policy for Clalit Health Services members, where the insured event occurred from 01/01/2025 onwards, the activity of entering and exiting the bath or shower shall not be inspected. In addition, assistance of an accessory in performing the action - shall not be deemed an entitling condition.

6. Mobility: The insured's independent ability to move from place to place. Execution of this activity independently without the help of others, while using crutches and/or a cane and/or walker and/or other accessory - including mechanical, motoric or electronic - shall not be considered impairment of the insured's independent ability to move. However, confinement to bed or wheelchair, without the insured's ability to move it independently, shall be considered inability of the insured to move. It should be emphasized that in the Mushlam Nursing Policy for the members of the Clalit Health Fund, the insured's inability to move without a wheelchair will be considered inability to move independently; however, if the insured has no ability to move without a wheelchair, however, has the ability to independently move with a wheelchair from place to place, in the course of the insurance period ending before 7 days in Tamuz 5777 (1.7.2017), and during the current insurance period, the insured's independent ability has changed in a manner that the insured cannot independently move with a wheelchair, the insured shall be deemed not to be able to move independently as and from the date his/her independent ability changed, as aforementioned.
- b.  Mental fatigue - the insured's poor health and functioning condition due to «mental fatigue» which is determined by a specialist in the feld.

## How is eligibility determined for receipt of a nursing benefit?

Examination of the eligibility to receive a nursing benefit is based on all of the insured's medical information, including medical documents and opinions, information regarding background illnesses and medicinal treatments which the insured receives or received, information about past hospitalizations, etc.

In addition, in a significant part of cases, the insured undergoes a functional assessment (physical/ cognitive examination) by a professional, on behalf of Harel, inter alia, in the field of functional and/or cognitive assessment. This examination by a professional will be carried out in coordination with the insured's family members or contact person.

The assessment will examine the functional and/or cognitive ability of the examinee in the home or similar setting (e.g. the institution where the insured resides) and not outside the home.

As part of the functional assessment, the professional will examine parameters such as the parameters included in the attached form. It should be noted that these parameters are presented for illustration purposes only and may change from time to time.

## The rules and tests for determining eligibility for receipt of a nursing benefit

## 1. Functional limitation

In the framework of the examination whether the insured's condition entitles the insured, in accordance with the policy conditions and provisions, to receive a nursing beneft, due to functional limitation examines the insured's functioning level in regard to each of the actions detailed in paragraph 'a' above, distributed into several functional levels, as follows:

- 1.1. Independence - this defnition includes situations where no other person's help is required to perform the action, and therefore the action is not defned as an action which the insured is unable to perform a substantial part thereof. This defnition includes two sub-conditions:
- 1.1.1. Full Independence (no assistance) - The insured does not require any assistance to perform the action and it can be performed safely in a reasonable time without accessories.
- 1.1.2. Independence with the aid of a device - the insured performs the action without the assistance of another person, however, while assisted with the aid of a device.
- 1.2. Dependency - In order to perform the action the insured requires another person for supervision or physical assistance, in the absence of which the action would not be performed at all. In some cases which are part of this group, the insured will be defned as unable to independently perform a substantial part of the action, as follows:
- 1.2.1. Minor dependency - The insured is capable of performing over 50% of the action and is therefore not defned as unable to perform a substantial part of the action. This functioning state includes the following cases:
- 1.2.1.1. Supervision or arrangement - In order to perform the action, supervision, prompting or persuasion are required, however, no assistance or physical contact is required, or alternatively, assistance is required in arranging or organizing accessories.
- 1.2.1.2. Minimal physical contact - Only slight physical contact is required to assist in performing the action.
- 1.3. Moderate / medium assistance - in order to perform the action greater assistance is required than contact, however, the insured performs more than 50% of the action and therefore is not defned as unable to perform a substantial part of the action.
- 1.4. Great dependency - the insured is able to perform less than 50% of the action and therefore great or full assistance help is required, in the absence of which the action will not be performed. In this condition the insured is defned as being unable to independently perform a substantial part of the action.

On the basis of these tests, an individual examination of the insured's ability to independently perform a substantial part of each of the six activities is performed including inter alia:

Control of sphincters - non- control of one of the sphincter shall be considered inability by the insured to perform a substantial part of the action of independent control of sphincters. An insured who, due to low bladder responsiveness - expressed, for example in urgent or frequent urination - who due to a diffculty in mobility is unable to control his/her sphincters, will be considered unable to independently perform a substantial part (at least 50% of the action) of the activity ״ sphincter control' as defned in the nursing circular letter.

For this purpose, ״ mobility diffculty - ״ a diffculty in mobility which does not amount to the insured's inability to independently perform a substantial part (at least 50% of the action) of the ״ mobility' actin as defned in a nursing circular letter.

Getting up and lying down - the insured's ability to perform a substantial part of the ״ getting up and lying down' action is assessed.

Mobility - the insured is defned as unable to perform a substantial part of the action when he/she cannot independently move in any way without assistance of another. An insured who suffers from imbalance or who instability causing repeated falls which impair the insured's independent ability to move from place to place, shall be deemed incapable to independently performing a substantial part (at least 50%) of the «mobility» action as defned in the nursing circular letter.

Eating - cutting, preparing and serving food shall not be considered inability to perform a substantial part of the eating action. A need for physical feeding of the insured will be considered inability to perform the action.

Bathing - the company takes into account for the purpose of examining the insured's ability to independently perform a substantial part of the operation, including the need for assistance 0getting in and out of a bath/shower. In this case, the company weights-up the assistance required for the actual bathing action with the insured's ability to enter and exit the bath/shower.

*In the Mushlam Nursing policy for Clalit Health Services members, where the insured event occurred from 01/01/2025 onwards, the need for assistance entering and exiting the bath/ shower shall not be inspected.

Dressing - for the purpose of examining the insured's ability to independently perform a substantial part of the action, the company shall also take into account the ability to put on a variety of clothing items. In the event of a need to attach an artifcial limb, the assistance required for the dressing action shall be weighted-up with assistance required to attach the artifcial limb.

*In the Mushlam Nursing policy for Clalit Health Services members, where the insured event occurred from 01/01/2025 onwards, the insured's ability to wear dress clothing adapted to the insured's condition or with the assistance of an accessory in performing the action - shall not be deemed inability by the insured to perform the action.

## 2. Mental fatigue

As aforementioned, mental fatigue is another condition which entitles receipt of a nursing beneft (in any event, the insured will be entitled to benefts in respect of only one entitling condition). The determination of mental fatigue will only be made by a specialist in the feld, i.e. a specialist in geriatrics, psychiatry, psychogeriatric specialist and/or neurologist.

For the purpose of this decision, the specialist physician will examine, inter alia, the history of the disease, general impression, medical follow up, and medicinal treatment.

## Claim for an approved period - for a period exceeding 3 months

Approval of a periodic claim for additional defned periods beyond the approved period, shall require - at the end of the period approved for payment - re-examination of the insured's medical and functional condition.

Upon re-examination of the liability and its performance, the insured's medical condition, age, the information provided to the company and the policy conditions shall be taken into account, inter alia.

The re-eligibility examination may be performed, inter alia, in accordance with the insured's condition and age by way of inspection of current medical documents regarding the insured's medical or functional condition, or by having the insured examined by appropriate professionals on behalf of Harel.

Towards the end of the eligibility period, Harel shall approach you for the purpose of conducting the re-eligibility examination. As part of this approach, you may be required to submit to Harel current medical documents or to schedule an examination to assess your current functional and medical condition, in the framework of the times noted in the request.

Failure to provide the requested documents timeously and/or non-cooperation regarding an examination by an appropriate professional determined by Harel in a timely manner may result in termination of payment of insurance benefts or delay in payment thereof.

Harel reserves the right to conduct a re-examination of your eligibility if necessary, even in cases where the insured's eligibility is confrmed for a predetermined period and during the period information is received by Harel which differs from that provided by the insured and/ or which was known to Harel and indicates that the insured may have ceased to be eligible for insurance benefts.

## A claim approved for a period of 3 months or less

In the event that a periodic claim is approved for a period of 3 months or less, and the insured believes that his medical and functional condition constitutes a justifcation for approval the claim for additional periods, towards the end of the period approved for payment the insured shall provide Harel with detailed information about his/her current condition.

Harel will determine its liability in accordance with the medical information provided by the insured and, if necessary, by way of examination of the insured by a professional on behalf of the company.

## General provisions

The above provisions constitute general principles for settling a nursing claim, presented as an example and illustration only and their publication shall not oblige the company to act exactly as noted in a specifc case. The Company reserves its right to change and adjust same from time to time as necessary to each individual case.

This includes modifying and adapting the functional evaluation form annexed to this Document of Principles.

It should be noted that in each case the binding conditions, for all intents and purposes, are the conditions set out in the insured's policy, and the eligibility for receipt of a nursing beneft - and its actual receipt - is subject to all the provisions and conditions set down in this policy, including, however, not limited to, medical exceptions, waiting periods, and the other policy provisions.

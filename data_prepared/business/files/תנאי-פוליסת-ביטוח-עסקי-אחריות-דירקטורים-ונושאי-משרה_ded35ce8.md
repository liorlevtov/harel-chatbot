If the director or officer of the company believes that as a result of such official investigation, examination, inquiry or other similar proceeding, circumstances exist which may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim, notice must be given to the insurer of the circumstances and the reasons for anticipating a claim, with full particulars as to dates and persons involved in accordance with General provision 5.5.

## 4.2 New Subsidiaries

Cover  under  this  policy  is  extended  to  any subsidiary which  the policyholder acquires  or creates after the inception date of this policy provided that the subsidiary:

If  a  newly  acquired  or  created subsidiary fails  to  meet  conditions  (i)  and  (ii)  above  the policyholder may  request an  extension  of  this  policy  for  such subsidiary provided that the policyholder shall  give  the insurer sufficient  details  to  permit  the insurer to  assess  and evaluate the insurer's potential increase in exposure. The insurer shall be entitled to amend the  policy  terms  and  conditions,  during  the policy  period, including  by  the  charging  of  a reasonable additional premium.

This cover shall be specifically excess of any insurance in force in respect of the outside entity as  well  as  any  indemnification  provided  by  the outside  entity .  If  the  other  insurance  is provided by the insurer (or  would  be  provided  except  for  the  application  of  the  retention amount or the exhaustion of the limit of liability), then the total aggregate limit of liability for

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

all loss covered by virtue of this extension shall be reduced by the limit of liability specified in the schedule of the other insurance  provided to the outside entity .

The  cover  provided  by  this  clause  shall  not  apply  in  connection  with  any claim made against any insured by the outside entity , any of its directors or officers or any shareholder of the outside entity holding more than 20 per cent of the issued and outstanding voting share capital of the outside entity.

If  the insurer refuses  to  offer  any  terms  or  conditions  to  renew  this  policy,  then  the policyholder shall have the right upon payment of an additional premium of 25 percent of the full annual premium to a discovery period of 12 months following the effective date of nonrenewal.

The insured shall  be  entitled  to  a  30  day discovery period at  no  additional  premium if  this policy is not renewed by either the policyholder or  the insurer .  If  the policyholder elects to purchase a discovery period , this 30-day discovery period shall be part of and not in addition to the purchased discovery period .

To purchase the discovery period , the policyholder must request its purchase in writing within 15 days of the termination date of the policy and must tender the additional premium within 30 days of the termination date.

The additional premium is not refundable and the discovery period is not cancellable.

If  a transaction takes  place,  then  the policyholder shall  not  have  the  right  to  purchase  a discovery period as set out above.  However, the policyholder shall have the right within 30 days of the end of the policy period to request an offer from the insurer of a discovery period for  up  to  72 months. The insurer shall  offer  a discovery period with  terms,  conditions  and premium as the insurer may reasonably decide.

<!-- image -->

as the spouse of an insured including any claim that seeks damages recoverable from marital community  property  or  property  jointly  held  by  the insured and  the  spouse;  provided, however, that this extension shall not afford cover for any claim for any wrongful act of the spouse and that this policy shall apply only to wrongful act(s) of an insured .

## 5. General provisions

## 5.1 Representation

In granting cover to any one insured, the insurer has relied upon the material statements and particulars  in  the  proposal  together  with  its  attachments  and  other  information  supplied. These  statements,  attachments  and  information  are  the  basis  of  cover  and  shall  be considered incorporated and constituting part of this policy.

## 5.2 Changes in Risk During Policy Period

- (i) If during the policy period a transaction takes place, then the cover provided under this  policy  is  amended  to  apply  only  to wrongful  act(s) committed  prior  to  the effective date of the transaction .
- (ii) If  during  the policy  period ,  the company decides  to  make  an  initial  offering  of  its securities in any jurisdiction, whether its securities are already traded or not, by any means, public or private, then as soon as the information is publicly available, the company shall provide the insurer with any prospectus or offering statement for the insurer's evaluation and assessment of the increased exposure of the insured and the insurer shall  be  entitled  to  amend  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  policy  and/or charge a reasonable additional premium reflecting the increase in exposure.

At the policyholder's request, prior to the public announcement of such securities offering, the insurer shall  evaluate  and  assess  the  increased  exposure  and  advise  of  all  necessary amendments to the terms and conditions of this policy and additional premium.

In  this  event  and  at  the  request  of  the policyholder ,  the insurer will enter  into  a confidentiality  agreement  with  the policyholder relating  to  any  information  provided regarding the proposed securities offering.

## 5.3 Limit of Liability

The  limit  of  liability  specified  in  Item  3  of  the  Schedule  is  the  total  aggregate  limit  of  the insurer's  liability  for  all  loss,  arising  out  of  all  claims  made  against  all  insureds  under  all insurance covers under this policy combined. The limit of liability for the discovery period shall  be  part  of  and  not  in  addition  to  the  total  aggregate  limit  of  liability  for  the  policy period.  Loss  arising  from  any  claim  which  is  made  subsequent  to  the  policy  period  or discovery  period  which  pursuant  to  General  provision  5.5  is  considered  made  during  the policy period or discovery period shall also be subject to the same total aggregate limit of liability.  Defence costs are not payable by the insurer in addition to the total aggregate limit of  liability.   Defence  costs  are  part  of  loss  and  are  subject  to  the  total  aggregate  limit  of liability for loss.

Notwithstanding the above, and solely in respect of a claim filed against an insured within the  jurisdiction  of  the  courts  of  Israel,  It  is  agreed  that  pursuant  to  Section  66  to  the Insurance Contract Law 5741-1981, in the event of a loss, including defence costs, exceeding the total aggregate limit of liability for loss, then this policy shall cover reasonable defence costs exceeding the total limit of liability for loss.

"Reasonable  Defence  Costs"  means:  fees  for  lawyers  who  represents  the  insured  in  legal procedures in court in regard with the loss provided always that the identity and the fees of the lawyers were approved by the Insurer prior to the engagement with them.

## 5.4 Retention

The insurer shall only be liable for the amount of loss arising from a claim which is in excess of the retention amount specified in Item 4 of the Schedule with regard to all loss under all insurance covers under this policy for which the company has indemnified or is permitted or required to indemnify the insured . The retention amount is to be borne by the company and shall remain uninsured . A single retention amount shall apply to loss arising from all claims alleging a single wrongful act.

Provided, however, that no retention shall apply and the insurer shall thereupon reimburse any defence costs paid by the company , in the event of:

- (i) a determination of no liability of all insureds , or
- (ii) a dismissal or a stipulation to dismiss the claim without prejudice and without the payment of any consideration by any insured.

Provided, however, that in the case of (ii) above, such reimbursement shall occur 90 days after the date of dismissal or stipulation as long as the claim is not re-brought (or any other claim which is subject to the same single retention by virtue of this General provision 5.4 is not brought) within that time, and further subject to an undertaking by the company in a form acceptable to the insurer that such reimbursement shall be paid back by the company to the insurer in the event the claim (or any other claim which is subject to the same single retention by virtue of this General provision 5.4) is brought after such 90 day period.

## 5.5 How to Give Notice and Report a Claim

- (i) Notice of a claim or  of  circumstances which may result in a claim shall be given in writing to Harel Insurance Company Ltd. 3 Abba Hillel St. Ramat-Gan 52118 fax no: 03-7547840. If posted the date of posting shall constitute the date that notice was given, and proof of posting shall be sufficient proof of notice.
- (ii) The company or the insured shall, as a condition precedent to the obligations of the insurer under this policy, give written notice to the insurer of any claim made against an insured as soon as practicable and either:
- (a) any time during the policy period or during the discovery period;

or

- (b) within 30 days after the end of the policy period or the discovery period, as long as such claim(s) is  reported  no  later than  30  days  after the  date  such claim was first made against an insured.
- (iii) If,  during  the policy period or  during the discovery period written notice of a claim against  an insured has  been  given  to  the insurer pursuant  to  the  terms  and conditions of this policy, then any claim arising out of, based upon or attributable to the facts alleged in the claim previously notified to the insurer or  alleging  a single wrongful  act which  is  the  same  as  or  related  to  any wrongful  act alleged  in  the previously notified claim , shall be considered made against the insured and reported to the insurer at the time the first notice was given.
- (iv) If during the policy period or during the discovery period , the company or the insured shall become aware of any circumstances which may reasonably be expected to give rise  to  a claim being  made  against  an insured and shall  give  written  notice  to  the insurer of  the  circumstances  and  the  reasons  for  anticipating  a claim ,  with  full particulars as to dates and persons involved, then any claim which is subsequently made against an insured and reported to the insurer arising out of, based upon or attributable to the circumstances or alleging any wrongful act which is the same as or related to any wrongful act alleged or contained in those circumstances, shall be considered  made  against  the insured and  reported  to  the insurer at  the  time  the notice of the circumstances was first given.

## 5.6 Advancement of Costs

The insurer shall advance to the insured or the company defence costs under all insurance covers under this policy before the final disposition of the claim .

The advance payments by the insurer shall be repaid to the insurer by the company or the insured, severally according to their respective interests, in the event and to the extent that the company or the insured shall not be entitled to payment of the loss under the terms and conditions of this policy.

In the event and to the extent that the company is permitted or required to indemnify the insured but for whatever reason fails to do so, the insurer will advance all defence costs to

<!-- image -->

the insured on behalf of the company. In this case, however, the retention amount specified in Item 4 of the Schedule shall be repaid by the company to the insurer, unless the company is insolvent.

## 5.7 How Defence Will Be Conducted

The insured shall have the right and duty to defend and contest any claim. The insurer shall have the right to effectively associate with the insured and the company in the defence and settlement of any claim that appears reasonably likely to involve the insurer, including but not limited to effectively associating in the negotiation of any settlement.

The insured shall  not  admit  or  assume  any  liability,  enter  into  any  settlement  agreement, stipulate to any judgment or incur any defence costs without the prior written consent of the insurer as a condition precedent to the insurer's liability for loss arising out of the claim.

Only those settlements, stipulated judgments and defence costs which have been consented to  by  the insurer shall  be  recoverable  as loss under the terms of this policy. The insurer's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that the insurer shall  be  entitled  to effectively  associate  in  the  defence  and  the  negotiation  of  any  settlement  of  any claim in order to reach a decision as to reasonableness.

The company and the insured shall give the insurer full co-operation and all information as it may reasonably require as a condition precedent to the insurer's liability for loss arising out of the claim .  In the event that a dispute arises between the insurer and the insured regarding whether or not to contest any legal proceedings, neither the insured nor the company shall be required to contest any legal proceedings unless a Queen's Counsel or equivalent (to be mutually agreed by the policyholder and the insurer ) shall advise that the proceedings should be contested.  The cost of the Queen's Counsel shall be borne by the insurer.

Accordingly, with respect to:
